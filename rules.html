                <strong>Rules:</strong> There is one winning number between 1-100, you
                get five attempts to guess the number. After every guess you will be
                given an indication of how close you are to the correct number, hot or
                cold, and whether to guess higher or lower. If you would like a more
                accurate hint, you can press the hint button, this will give you three
                numbers, one of which is the winning number. You may only have one hint
                per game. If you would like to play again or start with a fresh game
                press the reset button.
